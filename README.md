# Ariane-plugin-for-league-loader
my personally customized ariane for league loader that is designed to be extra weeb-y and feminine 

How to setup:
download league loader from the official league loader github repo and set it up,
copy the files in this repository into the plugins folder,
edit openai connector.py and put in your openai api key, save it and then run the python app.
get into a lobby or somwhere you can chat and use the command /ariane following up with your message or question.
